# Miniscripts

These are small scripts with code written by me or borrowed from all over the place

These just run commands that I use frequently

## What each file does

- [re.sh](./re.sh) - Runs redshift based of IP location
- [ss.sh](./ss.sh) - After a few seconds, takes a screenshot, saves it and copies to clipboard
- [ud.sh](./ud.sh) - Updates mirrorlist using reflector based on IP location
- [wf.sh](./wf.sh) - Changes wifi state using NetworkManager
